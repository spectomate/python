# Spectomate Architecture

## Overview

Spectomate is built on a modular architecture that makes it easy to extend and add new converters between different Python package management formats.

## Key Components

### 1. `BaseConverter` Base Class

All converters inherit from the `BaseConverter` base class, which defines a common interface and basic functionality:

- `read_source()` - reads the source file and converts it to an internal data format
- `convert()` - converts data from the source format to the target format
- `write_target()` - writes data in the target format to a file
- `execute()` - performs the full conversion process (read, convert, write)
- `get_source_format()` - returns the source format identifier
- `get_target_format()` - returns the target format identifier

### 2. Data Schemas

Each format has its own data schema that defines the data structure and methods for working with that format:

- `PipSchema` - schema for pip format (requirements.txt)
- `CondaSchema` - schema for conda format (environment.yml)
- `PoetrySchema` - schema for poetry format (pyproject.toml)

### 3. Converters

Converters implement the logic for conversion between different formats:

- `CondaToPipConverter` - conversion from conda format to pip format
- `PipToCondaConverter` - conversion from pip format to conda format
- `PipToPoetryConverter` - conversion from pip format to poetry format

### 4. Converter Registry

The converter registration system enables dynamic discovery and use of available converters:

- `register_converter` - decorator for registering a converter
- `get_converter` - function for retrieving a converter based on source and target formats
- `list_converters` - function for listing all available converters

## Data Flow

1. The user selects the source and target formats and file paths
2. The system selects the appropriate converter based on the formats
3. The converter reads the source file using the appropriate schema
4. The data is converted to the target format
5. The result is written to the target file using the appropriate schema

## Extending the System

To add a new converter:

1. Create a new class inheriting from `BaseConverter`
2. Implement the `read_source()`, `convert()`, `write_target()`, `get_source_format()`, and `get_target_format()` methods
3. Register the converter using the `@register_converter` decorator

To add a new format:

1. Create a new data schema with methods for parsing and generating files in that format
2. Implement converters between the new format and existing formats
